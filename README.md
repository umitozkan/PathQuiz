## Installation

First off, build the docker images

`docker-compose build`

Run the containers

`docker-compose up -d`

Now shell into the PHP container

`docker-compose exec php-fpm bash`

And install all the dependencies

`composer install`

#### Configuration Parameters

After hitting composer install, you will be prompted to fill in your parameters.
 
You may add the default ones given by hitting enter (as the values are set by Docker config), except for the **mailer parameters**, please update those with your mailer provider.

#### Creating the database schema

Once you've installed the dependencies, you may now create a database and the schema. 

You can do this by running the script, which will create a clean database and schema.

`bash install-clean.sh`

**Note: This script will actually delete any database that's already created, so be careful when using this.

#### Fixtures

If you want to create the database with some fixtures, you may run the script 

`bash install-import-fixtures.sh`

**Note: This script will actually delete any database that's already created, so be careful when using this.
